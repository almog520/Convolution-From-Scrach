# Convolution-From-Scrach

This Notebook was an assignment in Image Processing course. <br>

# The objective of this assignment:

1) Implement convolution function from scratch without lib fucntion except NumPy. Apply several filterls and compare with lib function.
2) Implement function called my_compose() it takes 2 picture np arrays and m (num of pixels). The objective of the function is to produce combined image that MSB (Most significant bit) of the first image, and 8-m bit of the second image.<br>
3) Create a function which detects if an image was forged.
